### Code.org GameLab
[Robot Face](https://aleksiag.github.io/RobotFace/)
> In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

[Captioned Scenes](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/LGWsL2KYnQowYCdzN2PAnSDlXHomySmGA9LKj4LQFgY)
> In this project I used random numbers, sprites, variables, and many shapes to create a scene from the children's book "The Hungry Caterpillar".

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/Ij4JCrzG5w7XjALoQWzJKTBn9QVPobZA8SEivBOBqrU)
> In this project I used multiple sprites with updated properties, conditionals responding to user input, and additonal conditonals that were triggered by a sprite property.

[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/dsGjFQRS4UDzsUmT36QHVgqecHx6_Xs85YLt8Els9ig)
> In this project I used sprites, controls, and various interactions to create a side scroller game.

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/PRY0-StNae3vhSQobhLq0-Ne-CEkNPjd0PtQUBNczKk)
> In this project I used different types of collisions to create a simple flyer game.

[Design Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/_cy3mgv5UiGlrnfH65i_J3cLNBdkk6JY-dbeAUQvfB8)
> In this project, I used 3 backgrounds, different types of user inputs, multiple sprite interactions, complex movements, and variable values such as a score to design a game.

[Hello It's Me](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=e73c83bb-213f-4f3a-a1ac-8dcd57aa259b)
> In this project, I used the MIT App Inventor programming application to create a animal sound app.

[My Piano](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=42a2d56d-22d8-4222-b1e3-60243101b586)
> In this project, I used the App Inventor Blocks Editor by applying the computational practices that assist in developing and testing an app in stages to create a piano playing app.

[Music Maker](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=275aaaae-e55e-4516-a849-978afaa08d80)
> In this project, I used the Layout components in App Inventor to control placement of components in their apps to create a intrument playing app.

[Find the Gold](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=3b9a8f1f-d454-4460-b4f4-8ff1afbfc137)
> In this project, I featured a Ball sprite that moves through the maze based on the user interaction of tilting the smartphone or tablet to create a maze game app.

[Food Chase](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=51687273-fd3d-4ec7-92e4-58e1434a1c52)
> In this project, I used variables correctly to store data and additionally used conditionals to correctly check two values within a program to create an app where the user controls a red ball with a flinging action.

[Creative Task Unit 1](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/exercise/4132/)
> In this project, I used the coding elements I have learned thus far in Unit 1 (Creating Drawings) to create a project of my own design.
